### Adding Your Own Effect

Pic Smasher is designed with a modular architecture, making it easy to add new effects. Follow these steps to add your own effect:

1. **Create a New Effect Class**
    - Open the `effects.js` file.
    - Define a new class for your effect that extends the `Effect` base class.

    ```javascript
    // effects.js
    class MyNewEffect extends Effect {
        static getName() {
            return 'My New Effect'; // The name of your effect as it will be displayed on the page
        }

        static getDefaultParameters() {
            return {
                // Default parameters for your effect
            };
        }

        static getControls() {
            return [
                // Controls for your effect
            ];
        }

        constructor(parameters = {}) {
            super(parameters);
            // Initialization code
        }

        apply(ctx, canvas) {
            // Your effect logic here
            // ctx is the rendering context for the canvas element, which provides the methods and properties to draw and manipulate graphics on the canvas.
            // canvas is the HTML canvas element where the effect will be applied.
        }
    }
    ```

2. **Register Your Effect**
    - Locate the `EffectManager` class within the `effects.js` file.
    - Register your new effect by adding it to the `effectsRegistry`.

    ```javascript
    // effects.js

    // ... All other effects defined here ...

    //const effectManager = new EffectManager();
    effectManager.registerEffect('myNewEffect', MyNewEffect); // registerEffect(effect id, effect class)
    ```

3. **Test Your Effect**
    - Run the application and apply your new effect to ensure it works as expected.
    - Write tests for your effect if applicable.

By following these steps, you can easily extend Pic Smasher with new and exciting effects. Happy coding!
